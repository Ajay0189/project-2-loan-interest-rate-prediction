Business Objective
A company is in the financial lending business. It provides loans to retail customers. It collects the information about the customers and analyzes it manually whether the customer is eligible or not. If the customer is eligible at what interest rate to be given to the requested loan is analyzed. 
Going forward the company, the company wants to employ an automated process that is based on a machine learning model. Not only is this model expected to make the decision process faster, but also keeping it free from human error and biases

UNDERSTANDING
We are given a data set which contains the information of the customers applied for loan
Based on the information given ,useful insights must be taken 
The analysis should define which features are affecting the target variable 
Target variable observed to be interest rate
An automated model need to be developed using the data set ,so that it predicts the target variable ,interest rate using the applied inputs

APPROACH
At first the preprocessing techniques need to performed on the data set which includes cleaning the data ,handling missing values and outliers
The next step includes visualization of the features and drawing useful insights from the data 
We have to perform some key analysis from the data and find out relations of independent features with target feature
As it is multiclassification problem we chose decision tree classifier as the algorithm to develop the model
